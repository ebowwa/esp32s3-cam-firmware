- **WiFi Detection** - Verification that hotspot appears in WiFi scans
- **Toggle Functionality** - Hotspot on/off switching

### ðŸ”— BLE Integration Tests
- **BLE Connection Tracking** - Verifies BLE connection status in hotspot data
- **Data Statistics** - Tests combined BLE + WiFi data tracking
- **Interface Monitoring** - Validates active interface reporting
- **Command Tracking** - Confirms BLE command reception counting

## Requirements

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install bleak asyncio-mqtt pywifi
```

### Hardware Requirements
- ESP32S3 device with hotspot firmware loaded
- Computer with Bluetooth capability
- WiFi adapter (for network scanning)

## Usage

### Basic Test Run
```bash
python test_hotspot_functionality.py
```

### Expected Output
```

```

## Test Sequence

1. **BLE Integration Test** - Verifies BLE connection data is properly integrated
2. **Hotspot Start Test** - Starts hotspot and verifies activation
3. **Status Request Test** - Requests and validates status data
4. **WiFi Detection Test** - Scans for hotspot in available networks
5. **Toggle Test** - Tests hotspot on/off switching
6. **Stop Test** - Stops hotspot and verifies deactivation

## BLE Protocol

### Control Commands
- `0x00` - Stop hotspot
- `0x01` - Start hotspot
- `0x02` - Toggle hotspot
- `0x03` - Get status update

### Status Response Format
```
Byte 0: Hotspot status (0=disabled, 1=starting, 2=active, 3=error)
Byte 1: Connected WiFi clients
Byte 2: Max WiFi clients
Byte 3: BLE connection status (0=disconnected, 1=connected)
Byte 4: Active interfaces bitmask (0x01=BLE, 0x02=WiFi)
Bytes 5-8: Total data transmitted (all interfaces, little endian)
Bytes 9-12: BLE data transmitted (little endian)
Byte 13: SSID length
Bytes 14+: SSID string
Byte X: IP address length
Bytes X+1: IP address string
```

  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Device Not Found**
- Ensure ESP32S3 is powered on and advertising
- Check device name is "OpenGlass"
- Verify Bluetooth is enabled on test computer

**Connection Failed**
- Device may already be connected to another client
- Try restarting ESP32S3 device
- Check Bluetooth permissions

**WiFi Scan Failed**
- `pywifi` library may not be compatible with your OS
- WiFi tests will be skipped automatically
- Manual verification can be done with system WiFi settings

**Status Parsing Errors**
- Firmware may be using different protocol version
- Check raw_data field in logs for debugging
- Verify BLE characteristics are properly implemented

## Integration with Firmware

This test script validates the BLE integration features added to the hotspot manager:

- **Connection Tracking** - BLE connect/disconnect events update hotspot statistics
- **Data Monitoring** - All BLE transmissions are tracked and reported
- **Command Counting** - BLE commands are counted for activity analysis
- **Combined Statistics** - Hotspot provides unified view of BLE + WiFi data

The enhanced hotspot manager provides comprehensive connectivity statistics that combine both BLE and WiFi data streams for better device monitoring and management.
